# Network Teleoperation

This tutorial explains how to operate a follower robot from a different PC using the provided TCP scripts.

## Prerequisites
- LeRobot installed on both machines
- Both computers must share the same local network

## Start the follower
Run the follower server on the robot side:

```bash
python lerobot/scripts/follower_server.py --robot.type=<follower_type> --robot.port=<port>
```

By default the server listens on port `5555`. You can change this with `--port`.

## Start the leader
Launch the leader client on your control PC:

```bash
python lerobot/scripts/leader_client.py --teleop.type=<leader_type> --teleop.port=<port>
```

The client scans the network for the follower and connects automatically. Once the connection is established, actions from the leader are forwarded to the follower arm.

## Troubleshooting
- **Follower not found**: specify the IP range with `--network-range` and ensure that both machines are reachable (use `ping`).
- **Connection refused**: verify that the follower server is running and that no firewall blocks port `5555` (or your chosen port).
- **Connection lost**: check the network quality and restart both scripts if necessary.
- **Handshake errors**: make sure both machines run the same version of LeRobot.
